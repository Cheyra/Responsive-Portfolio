        <!--Bio Info-->
        <p>Web Development I find to be an enriching field which utilizes both critical thinking and creativity. My current
            expertise lay in front end web development however I am working towards full stack development through a coding
            boot camp offered through UNH.
            <br>
            <br> I have worked on various projects utilizing HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
            <br>
            <br> In this program I will learn how to use other coding languages to do backend web development such as Java and
            Python. I know Web Development is a constantly changing and evolving field and I am ready to grow as a developer
            by constantly immersing myself in code.
